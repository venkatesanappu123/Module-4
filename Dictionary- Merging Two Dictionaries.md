## Dictionary Operations in Python: Merging Two Dictionaries

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that merges **two dictionaries** and combines their key-value pairs.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define two dictionaries `dict1` and `dict2` with some key-value pairs.
2. Define a function `merge()` that merges the two dictionaries using the `**` unpacking operator.
   - The merged result will combine keys from both dictionaries. If a key exists in both, the value from `dict2` will overwrite that from `dict1`.
3. Call the `merge()` function and print the merged dictionary.

## 🧾 Program
```
dict1 = {'Ten': 10, 'Twenty': 20, 'Thirty': 30}
dict2 = {'Thirty': 30, 'Fourty': 40, 'Fifty': 50}

def merge(dict1, dict2):
    res = {**dict1, **dict2}
    return res

dict3 = merge(dict1, dict2)
print(dict3)
```
## Output
![441716555-11bf89e6-58ae-42c9-b151-39b83741ab95](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad5af9b4-227f-43b9-9e3e-75dc7127169f)

## Result
Thus the program that merges two dictionaries and combines their key-value pairs is executed successfully.
